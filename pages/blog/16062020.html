			Jumping into C programming with no background proved to be harder than I initially thought. Rather than keeping all my momentum going, the sprite maker project
			stopped it dead. I'm going to continue to work on it, but in the name of keeping this site afloat with regular updates, I'm going to try and get up smaller projects
			more regularly.

			Just what should those projects be? I think it would be smart to continue learning javascript. I think something involving data visualization would be cool. 
			Keeping with my fitness theme, I could build something that projects your weight loss forward in time. For instance, you plug in your height, weight, activity level,
			and daily calorie goal and it'll give you a graph displaying how much weight you should be losing based on your calculated TDEE. I could also put in a slider that
			lets you see how much time to put on the graph. I'll start today.
