			<a href="../projects/weightprojector.html">Right now</a> I have a little tool that takes your weight, height, age, and sex and calculates your TDEE. So far, so
			unoriginal. Tomorrow I will start working on a loop that will take your TDEE and your calories per day and construct an array based on how your weight is projected
			to change each week. I want it to re-calculate tdee for each weekly entry to better match the slow leveling off of weight loss as you approach your goal weight, and
			that will be the hardest part of the loop. I'll then have an input for "weeks until goal weight," which will be a measure of the length of the array. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm making a whole array of data, rather than just having a simple function to calculate the weeks left, for step 3 of the project, which will be to automatically
			construct a SVG line graph of your weight loss progress. That will be the hardest thing I've done in js, and I think it'll take at least three days of work.
