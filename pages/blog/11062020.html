			I will be using this space to host projects I am working on, writing I do, and information about me. I'm writing these pages on notepad and doing all the HTML from scratch.
			I'm making this the "hard way" in order to learn how to build websites, as a form of dipping my toe into front-end web development. My brother, a programmer, is giving me some helpful tips. Google
			has also been an invaluable resource. For my next project, which I will blog about, I will write a little javascript program about exercise. Probably just a simple programming
			chart that takes how many push ups you can do as input and gives you a table that tells you a push-up routine. Hopefully it goes well, and I can get a little bit more stuff
			to put on this site!
