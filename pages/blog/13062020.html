		<p>
			First project done, which you can check out over at my <a href="../projects.html">projects page.</a> It does exactly what I set out to do: takes a weight and reps
			value and calculates your one rep max, and then gives you a progressive overload 5x5 workout based on that one rep max. Probably the most useful thing I learned from
			doing that is to use google chrome's console for debugging, which my brother Joe told me about. For a few hours I was just banging my head against the wall trying to
			understand why my code wasn't working until I checked the console and saw I had the wrong case for my getElementById function. But I still got it done, and in not
			that much time, considering I didn't know anything about javascript before this. I'm glad I chose something very easy for my first project, cause now I have all this
			momentum for learning.
		</p>
		<p>
			In an effort to keep the momentum going, I'm going to brainstorm a new project to work on. I want something multi-day, because I feel like the biggest opportunity to
			lose momentum happens when trying to figure out what to do next. Joe told me about this C library called raylib which makes rendering for video games easier, so I might
			work on a project where I do something with that. I was thinking about a more creative-focused project, like a little 32x32 pixel art sprite creator, where you choose
			from a list of clothes and hair to make a custom sprite. It would be a good creative practice cause I would have to design the GUI as well as all the clothes and such
			for the sprite, and maybe make or select my own little chiptune track to play as background music. This idea will probably be my next project, though I don't know if
			I'll bother looking at the code today. Instead, I think I'll draw all the assets for it, and then work on the coding tomorrow.
