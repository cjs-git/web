			As I said yesterday, my first project is going to be a simple javascript tool. I hope to have a working prototype up by the end of the day today.
			I know I said I wanted it to be a push-up program, but I think a more versatile program would be a relative intensity calculator. I need to do research to
			find the right values for what I want, but basically I want a program that takes a weight that you've lifted and how many reps you did, calculate your one 
			rep max, and then give you a simple 5x5 routine for increasing strength at that strength level.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm thinking, just as an estimate, it'll give you three warm-up sets at 50% of your 1RM, then five working sets, starting at 80% and then going up by 2 percentage
			points each set, until you're at 90% of your 1RM. This is a little bit over the relative intensity of your 1RM, since your 5RM should be 87% of your 1RM, but
			that's where the progressive overload comes in. You try in your last set to go <i>above</i> what you've done before.
		</p>
		<p>
			Technical challenges will include: creating two input boxes, populating a table with values according to a formula, and making the calculations round all the values
			to increments of 5lbs, since the smallest plates available at most gyms is 2.5lbs, which adds 5lbs when placed one on each side of a barbell. Depending on how things
			go, I might also include all the weights in kilograms, but since all the numbers are in the same unit of weight, their relative values should be the same. Ideally,
			the user should be able to type in any weight, in pounds or kilograms, and get numbers that make sense.
