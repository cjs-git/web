		<p>
			My name is Christian Sweeney. I'm 22 years old, and I live in Connecticut. I went to University of Connecticut for my bachelor's degree, where I majored in physics.
			I have many interests, but they can be divided into three main "questions" which they inform.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first "question" that I'm interested in is "How do I stay healthy?" And the subjects that inform that question are obvious topics like nutrition, cooking, and 
			exercise, but even more tangential topics like mental hygeine or stress maintenence can have big impacts on how healthy you feel.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next big "question" is "What is human nature?" And a lot of humanities topics, like history, philosophy, and literature try to answer that question.
			More recently, there are also social sciences, like psychology, economics, and anthropology, that lend their own, more quantitative outlook on human nature.
		</p>
		<p>
			The last "question" is more vague, but goes something like "How does humanity progress?" It seems like at some points in history, like after the fall of the Roman
			Empire, European society seemed to "forget" certain technologies, or at least lost the collective will to maintain, say, the roman aquaduct system. I'm interested in
			trying to understand what educational, material, and historical circumstances lead to periods of "forgetting" like these, so that I can better try to achieve the reverse,
			a period of <i>increased</i> learning.
